    Today marks the end to my first module in the Flatiron School curriculum. This 
    point is marked with the completion of my first portfolio project, a CLI gem 
    written with Ruby, and the experience was nothing short of a thrilling 
    rollercoaster. The journey was littered with ups and downs but thankfully mostly 
    ups to my amazement. I was fortunate enough to get a good head start on 
    starting the project which I am so incredibly thankful for and used it to really try 
    to take my time to plan it out and code.

    My approach to the project build out was to try to cover at least one use of each
    of the skills we have learned up to this point. I think I delivered relatively well on
    this goal, perhaps not hitting everything but I did my best to cover as much as 
    possible. One of the main focus points for me was just trying to make sure that I 
    was creating and using objects with the data that was gathered from scraping 
    and not just showing the scraped and parsed data to the user. It’s all to easy to 
    want to display the data as is once you actually get the desired results from a 
    scrape, but be cautious here. The goal of learning about object oriented 
    programming is to do just that, program with objects.

    The next area that I started out feeling strong on but had some difficulties with 
    at the end was remembering what I was writing methods for. A whole class? An 
    instance of the class? Self? Should self be used ? And if self, then what is self at 
    that moment? This can get out of hand quickly and the ending result is a lot of 
    class methods that are acting on the whole class. If I could offer any advice it 
    would be to always ask yourself, “What am I writing this method to be called 
    on?”. Asking this first and really taking the time to answer this question will save 
    a great amount of time and frustration later on. Having to go back and re-write 
    the code to be used as an instance method instead of a class method and then 
    testing it only to find out that while the new instance method may be correct it 
    has now broken other parts of the program that was using that method in its 
    previous form. With the end of the beginning now upon me I have to say that I 
    am so thankful for this project and am even more excited for the rest of the 
    curriculum to gift its knowledge to me and let it change me for the better.
